Creative Features:
1.	A. size slider- if you want to init the shape in a bigger / smaller size- just move the slider!!
	B. redo- to redo the last shape that was initialized
	C. save view as a photo in your photo library
	D. change the background color of the view to what ever color you want with 3 sliders- red, green. Blue
2.	A, B â€“ added the feature (button / slider) and played a bit with the properties. A and B are not special features and we already sew this kind of features. For the size slider I added a size property to "shape"
	C- this action we did not see in class, so it was a research online- to understand you need to convert the View to a UIimage and only then to save to library, and to understand how to work with extensions
	D- the most difficult feature, making a second View Control, to link it and to understand what the best way is to move the information around. This was for me one of the difficult features to make in the Lab.
3.	In a drawing app, we want to give the client the most choices to make, and all these features are allowing the client to be more active and to spend more time in the drawing app.
